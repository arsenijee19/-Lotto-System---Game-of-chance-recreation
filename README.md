# Lotto-System---Lucky-game-of-chance-recreation
Recreation of a famous lotto game of chance where user selects 6 numbers in range from 1 to 24. The player is considered the winner if all selected numbers are drawn. 

The project was made as a graduation assignment in high school. The original and final idea was to bring the user a picture of gambling and games of chance in a painless, interactive, creative and, above all, free way. Using math, probability and statistics, the chances of winning the game are 1 / 134,596.

Big thanks to GitHub user savked (https://github.com/savked) who has allowed me to use the image material, which is also used in his similar thematic project.
